Google Developer Groups aim to connect local developers and technology enthusiasts to learn about technical topics and gain new skills through hands-on workshops, training, events, talks and meetups, both online and in-person. They also encourage members to apply knowledge and connections to build products and make career advancements.",
        "Appointed as chapter leader for the new group is Kelley Coelho, a veteran of the U.S. Army Reserves, a private investigator and founder of B and C Investigations. Coelho admittingly doesn’t have the most extensive background in technology, though she has seen the impacts of technology in businesses and everyday life first-hand.",
        "“I really don't have a huge background in tech, but I've connected with people and I’ve seen how important it is while at other companies that I've been involved with. They work hand in hand with it. Technology keeps things very streamlined through an organization. So that's what the really nice part is,” Coelho said. “I’m grateful to be appointed to this position even though I don't have that background because I’m passionate and I want to learn, get involved and help others navigate this growing industry. This is an opportunity for people from all backgrounds to come together, whether they are experts or if they are just wanting to learn.”",
        "Every Google Developer Group across the globe meets on a monthly basis, discussing varying topics like Google tools, web and software development, technology solutions, tech careers and technological advancements like artificial intelligence. Chapter leaders meet with Google representatives each week to discuss new Google technologies, industry news and to collaborate on projects.",
        "“The thing about tech is that there's always new stuff coming out. I think it's really nice to be surrounded by a really great group learning together and collaborating,” Coelho said.",
        "Speaking at next month’s launch will be Gustavo Nava of Livermore Labs, who will talk about how he got his start in the tech industry.",
        "“It’s things like this that are important to share,” Coelho said. “Turlock is growing and the industry is growing, and there are a lot of opportunities coming about and more people are becoming interested, but they just don’t know where to start or they don’t know how to move up… This can help somebody get further. With these Google connections, you’re able to build some really great relationships. I think this will definitely bring more opportunities to Turlock and people are going to have more of an open mindset.”",
        "There is no charge to join a Google Developer Club. The March 14 launch party will run from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. For more information, head to https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-turlock.",

The hope is that every local ethnic group will have students who want to become a York Fellow,” said Jeffrey Lewis, President and CEO of LHE, in a press release.",
        "The new scholarship program is named after Denair resident and retired nurse Jonnie York. During her decades-long career, York worked as a public health nurse with Stanislaus County in the Child Health and Disease Prevention Department, worked with in-home and public health nursing and helped people with unmet needs find health and wellness services.",
        "“I am deeply honored by the creation of this program. Educating more nurses and nurse practitioners will help ensure our communities have access to better healthcare, and it is time people realize that nurses are the true frontline of the healthcare workforce,” said York in a press release.",
        "During her years working as a registered nurse in Stanislaus County, there was one problem York saw over and over again — a lack of medical professionals in the local area.",
        "Whether it was the “working poor” as York called the patients she saw through the county health department or pregnant women seeking prenatal care, getting an appointment with a doctor is difficult due to a high demand and medical professionals.",
        "York was on the Legacy Health Endowment Board when they helped establish the Family Nurse Practitioner master’s program at Stanislaus State in 2018. She advocated at the time for extending the help further “upstream” by reaching nursing students before they obtained their bachelor’s degree to encourage them to continue their professional education.",
        "“If we want more people going into the master's program, then we need to help more people become bachelor’s prepared, and even eventually help more people get their a nursing through MJC…because that would increase the number of people getting to the end goal, which is to get more providers in the area,” said York in an interview with the Journal.",

        "Twenty-eight years ago when the Iyer family purchased a charry farm on the outskirts of Gustine, they did it with the vision that they could cultivate the 20-acres into a successful operation.",
        "One hiccup, however, existed. Those initial cherries were not good. In fact, Managing Partner Lax Iyer described them as “old” and “nasty.”",
        "“But we used them to learn,” Iyer said. And learn they did.",

        "Today, Meena Farms, which has grown to 800 acres of cherry trees, is known across the globe for their flavorful harvest and superior quality. Their orchards became a place where tradition met innovation when they opened a custom packing operation and are currently embarking on Meena Packing, which will see the entire operation from harvest to packing all at one facility, rather than having the cherries shipped to another facility to be packed and then loaded up for shipping, all of which can impact the flavor, explained General Manager Chris Medeiros.",
        "“As soon as you pull that cherry from the tree, its time clock starts,” Medeiros said. “It’s like sand in the hourglass and you only have so much time to get it from your field to the consumer. How you handle the product is extremely important. Cold chain is paramount. So, having something centrally located made sense for our operation.”",
        "Meena Farms is taking the same dedication to quality and applying it to Meena Packing.",
        "“This will be the most state-of-the-art cherry facility probably in North America,” Medeiros said. “Each piece of fruit is picked by hand and each is sorted individually. Then it’s run under high speeds by a camera as it is rotated. There’s dozens of pictures taken of that piece of fruit externally. Internally, we can see if there’s some defect near the pit. We can sort them by size, shape, color, firmness and now there is even technology that will allow us to sort by Brix level, which is the sugar level. It’s put into a box and we can trace back to that box that piece of fruit to the ranch and where it came from. That’s how state-of-the-art we are talking about.”",
        "The facility is expected to be in operation for this harvest and Meena Packing is looking to hire from 250 to 300 workers for the season. Those interested in working at the facility can apply online at meenafarms.com or drop off a resume at the dropbox location at 581 4th Ave., in Gustine or call 209-710-5716.",

        "“I think that goes to show you that we have a very strong and vibrant agriculture economy and community,” said Linda Pinfold, the Stanislaus County ag commissioner. “ I’m very proud and honored that I get to serve that community.”",
        "Santa Barbara and Grant County, Wash. — the only non-California county to crack the list — rounded out the top 10 with $2.6 billion total production value each.",
        "“Once again, California has the top agricultural counties in the nation, which is a testament to the resilience and innovation of all those involved in food production,” said California’s Food and Agriculture Secretary Karen Ross. “I wish to thank our partners at NASS for the very detailed work required to produce the Census. These data are essential as we consider allocation of resources in our ongoing commitment to help California’s farmers and ranchers remain sustainable and flourishing.”",
        "Census of Agriculture information, which is collected directly from producers, shows a continued decline in the total number of California farms. However, the data also show an increase in the value of agriculture sales in California.",
        "“I think it’s so cool to learn that we rank so high in the nation,” said Caitie Diemel, executive director of the county’s Farm Bureau. “Stanislaus County is pretty unique in that the average-size farm here is smaller than that of the state’s average farm. That’s because we have a lot of small, family-owned farms, working hard to produce so much good, safe food here in California, and I couldn’t be more proud.”",
        "Milk was the No. 1 commodity for Stanislaus County in 2022, followed by almonds, combining to make up 50 percent of the county’s entire production.",
        "The 2022 ag census shows the following key trends for the state:",
        "· The number of farms decreased to 63,134, down 10 percent from 2017 with an average size of 383 acres (up 10 percent) on 24.2 million acres of farmland (down 1 percent).",
        "· The market value of agricultural products sold totaled a national-best $59 billion — up $13.8 billion from 2017 — and that’s more than $15 billion ahead of No. 2 Iowa.",
        "· Total farm production expenses totaled $49.3 billion, up $11.5 billion from 2017.",
        "· At 16,699 farms, California is the top state using renewable energy producing systems in agriculture. Solar is the most common renewable energy producing system on farms and ranches in The Golden State.",
        "· Fresno County’s 2022 agricultural sales were greater than that of 23 separate states.",
        "· The average age of the California farmer is 59.9, up from 59.2 in 2017.",
        "It’s that last statistic that has Pinfold concerned about the future of farming.",
        "“Who’s going to be our future farmers?” said Pinfold. “Who’s going to take the mantle and keep that going strong? A lot of our farms are multi-generational. A lot of people grew up on farms but don’t come back to farm. Who’s going to be the next? That to me is important.”",
        "The national response rate for the 2022 Census of Agriculture was 61 percent; more than 40 percent of responses were submitted online. California’ response rate was 56 percent. Additional statistical reports, including state and county profiles and congressional districts, will be released throughout 2024.",

        "After a month living at the Ronald McDonald House in Palo Alto and traveling to nearby Stanford Medical Center for routine check-ups following his Dec. 20 kidney transplant surgery, Turlock Christian middle schooler Jaxon Shaneyfelt and his family are back home. And similar to how the Turlock Christian campus community came together for a send-off on Dec. 18, hundreds filled the parking lot of Monte Vista Chapel on Monday to welcome him back to school.",

        "Shaneyfelt, understandably, was also overjoyed.",
        "“It is really nice to be back with my friends,” he said. “They have been there for me from the start. Helping me look for a kidney and praying for me and I am really happy to be back at school. Today was a nice surprise.”",
        "The 14-year-old’s return to school brought a sense of normalcy that he hadn’t felt in more than a year. In December 2022, he was diagnosed with juvenile nephronophthisis — fibrosis that impairs kidney function and leads to life-threatening failure of kidney function. It wasn’t until this past November that doctors were able to match him with a living donor, 40-year-old Sarah Best of Sacramento.",
        "Shaneyfelt’s kidney function is normal and his body has adjusted to medication, though he will still be under a doctor’s care.",
